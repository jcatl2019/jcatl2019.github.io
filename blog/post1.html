      asper Jones is a novel written in 2009 by Australian author Craig Silvey.  Set in 1960’s Australia, it follows Charles ‘Charlie’ Bucktin, Jasper Jones and Jeffrey Lu in the small Western Australian town of Corrigan. Craig Silvey uses this medium of story to explore contextual issues that were faced in 1960’s Australia. Silvey covers issues such as the treatment/mis-treatment of Aboriginal, Torres Strait islanders and social outcasts. He also covers the effects of the Vietnam War on the town, and country.
      <br>
      Treatment of non-white Australians: The decade portrayed in the novel (1960’s) gave way to important change to how non-white Australians were seen in the country, and Craig Silvey conveys this through the context of his novel.
      In the novel, the titular Jasper Jones is the town outcast. He is blamed for anything bad that happens in the town, and is seen as this ‘corrupting influence’, which the children of the town can use to get out of any trouble.
      On page seven, it says (talking about Jasper Jones)“He’s the rotten model that parents hold aloft as a warning: This is how you’ll end up if you’re disobedient.” Using didactism, Silvey creates a cautionary tale to the children about how you will end up if you don’t obey your parents.
      The town has this pre-concieved notion that Jasper Jones is a scummy character and throughout the book this is shown in how not only the town percieves the situation but how Jasper Jones himself recounts his treatment in jail.
      However, Jasper Jones isn’t the only non-white Australian in Corrigan, there is also the Vietnamese Lu family. The Lu family is given a lot of abuse in the town as well, with Jeffrey Lu (Charlie’s friend) being one of the kids bullied at his school.
      Jeffrey brings a light-hearted and resilient demeanor to counter the racism he encounters. This is Silvey’s way of showing the treatment of non-white Australians in a time where they weren’t accepted.
      An example of this is Charlie and Jeffrey are playing scrabble, where Charlie wins to which Jeffrey replies “My ingrish. Is no goot”, as a joke about his Vietnamese heritage. Linking into the Vietnam War, Silvey uses the context to relate his text to both of these issues present in his book.
