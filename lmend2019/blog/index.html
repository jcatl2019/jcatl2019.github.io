    <p class="card-text">Trump: "Jesus reincarnated"</p>
    <p class="card-text"> Written By: Luke Mendes
      <br>
      New technologies in the field of DNA predictive algorithms have proved conclusively that Donald J. Trump is the direct descendant of Jesus Christ. The University of the Christian Heart, Alabama, yesterday released a controversial study claiming that a match had been found between Mr Trump’s DNA and the predicted DNA of our saviour, The Lord;
      Jesus Christ.
      <br>
      The discovery came after the University Of the Christian Heart was notified by a mysterious source (that the University claims was a vision from the Lord) that Jesus Christ was in fact, not lone heir of God.
      Predictably, the University was skeptical and set their finest technological team to the task of developing a predictive algorithm for distinguishing between a variety of differing DNA samples.
      Led by Professor Charles Mendes, the team discovered that by integrating the thymine strand of DNA with Phenolphthalein (a chemical used in pH indicating); they were able to isolate the ratio of thymine to oxytocin.
      This ratio is individual to everyone, no two people share the same ratio. Using this method, researchers were able to predict with  98.76% accuracy, parentage and hereditary factors going back four-hundred generations.
      For Mr Trump, this discovery perfectly coincided with allegations that he was not biologically connected to his father.
      It is reported that when he went for blood tests, to prove his paternal lineage, the samples were “accidentally” swapped with a batch meant for analysis at the Christian Heart University.
      Approximately two weeks ago the results were sent to the White House. Three days later, in a staggering turn of events, the classified information was posted onto the renowned site, Wikileaks.
      The founder of Wikileaks (Julian Assange) was later quoted as saying “we were given this information by a classified source, all I can reveal is that it is entirely trustworthy.”
      In a press conference this morning, Sean Spicer, Mr Trump’s Press Secretary and Communications Director was reported as saying
      "Mr Trump has known his divine descendancy for many years, It is in his firm belief that it is in fact the very reason that he is such a kind, empathetic, respectful and humanitarian man.”
